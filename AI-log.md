## ## 1. Tools Used

### **ChatGPT (Primary AI Assistant)**
- Used for generating problem statements, use cases, README, and test plans.
- Assisted in creating structured Markdown files and providing explanations.

### **python_user_visible Tool**
- Used to create `.md` files directly inside the project directory (`/mnt/data/`).
- Ensured clean file generation without relying on external converters.

## 2. Prompts Used & Their Purpose

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| *“Is ky according problemstatement btao mujhe”* | Requested explanation of the problem statement based on the provided image. |
| *“English main btao jani”* | Asked for the problem statement in English. |
| *“Problemstatement.md ki file main chahiye”* | Prompted generation of the `problemstatement.md` file. |
| *“Ab mujhe usecases.md ki file chahiye is k according”* | Requested creation of the `usecases.md` file. |
| *“Ab mujhe readme.md ki file chahiye is k according”* | Initiated creation of the project README file. |
| *“Testplan.md – 3–5 cases…”* | Asked for a structured test plan with multiple case types. |
| *“AI-log.md – tools used, prompts, what they were used for…”* | Prompt to generate this AI log file. |

## 4. Potential Risks & Considerations

### ⚠️ **Over-reliance**
- Relying too much on AI for documentation may reduce critical thinking or understanding of the system.

### ⚠️ **Accuracy Risks**
- AI may generate content that sounds correct but needs human validation (especially technical details).
- Actual test results must be verified manually.

### ⚠️ **Context Misinterpretation**
- If the prompt is unclear, AI may generate incorrect or incomplete documentation.

### ⚠️ **Security & Privacy**
- Users must avoid giving sensitive or confidential information in prompts as AI logs may be stored depending on platform settings.

## 5. Final Reflection

Using AI significantly improved the speed and clarity of documentation creation. The tools were especially effective for:
- Structuring Markdown files  
- Generating standardized technical documents  
- Automating repetitive tasks  

However, AI outputs should be reviewed carefully to ensure correctness, and sensitive data should never be included in prompts.
