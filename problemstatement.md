# Problem Statement – Learning Path Recommender

Design a Learning Path Recommender that helps a user move from their current skill level to a clearly defined learning goal in a specific domain (e.g., “become a junior web developer” or “learn the basics of data analysis”).

## Inputs Required
1. **Current skills** – what the user already knows  
2. **Background** – educational or professional  
3. **Time availability** – how much time the user can commit  

## System Output
### 1. **A short, prioritized learning path**
A focused sequence of topics or activities the user should follow in the correct order.

### 2. **A simple 4–6 week roadmap**
A realistic weekly plan showing what the user should learn each week.  
The roadmap may include resource pointers such as videos, websites, or readings.

## Goal of the System
- Provide a clear starting point  
- Give immediate and actionable next steps  
- Avoid overwhelming the user with too many resources  
- Deliver a practical, realistic learning plan that helps the user achieve their goal efficiently
